\noindent Instructions:  %Below is a list of assigned exercises and supplemental exercises. Only the assigned exercises are to be turned in.  
Homework is to be neat and organized.  \textbf{If it's messy it's wrong.} Answers without the necessary supporting work are worth 0.   You may discuss problems with others but must always produce your own work and write your own solutions.  Copying someone else's homework is considered cheating.\\


\noindent \textbf{HW6, due 11/9}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that $u(x,t)=\cos{4t}\sin{3x}$ satisfies the wave equation for an appropriate choice of $c$.
\item Verify that $u(x,t)=e^{-25t}\sin{\omega x}$ satisfies the heat equation for an appropriate choice of $c$.
\item Verify that $u(x,t)=v(x+ct)+w(x-ct)$ satisfies the wave equation for any twice differentiable functions $v(z)$ and $w(z)$.
\item Verify that $u(x,y)=A\ln{(x^2+y^2)}+B$ satisfies the Laplace equation.  Find $A$ and $B$ such that $u$ satisfies the boundary conditions: $u=7$ on the circle $x^2+y^2=1$ and $u=0$ on the circle $x^2+y^2=e^2$.
